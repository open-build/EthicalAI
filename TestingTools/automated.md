Automated Tools for Ethical AI Testing:

1. IBM AI Fairness 360: (https://aif360.mybluemix.net/)
   - An open-source toolkit that provides algorithms, metrics, and tutorials for detecting and mitigating bias in AI models.

2. AI Explainability 360: (https://aix360.mybluemix.net/)
   - Another IBM open-source toolkit that offers a comprehensive set of tools for interpreting and explaining machine learning models.

3. Google's What-If Tool: (https://pair-code.github.io/what-if-tool/)
   - An interactive tool for exploring the behavior of machine learning models, helping users understand model predictions and their implications.

4. FAT Forensics: (https://fatconference.org/resources/fat-forensics.html)
   - A Python library for detecting and visualizing bias in machine learning models using Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency principles.

5. Microsoft Fairlearn: (https://fairlearn.org/)
   - A toolkit that helps developers assess and mitigate unfairness in their AI models, providing support for multiple fairness metrics.

6. Responsible AI Toolkit: (https://toolkit.responsible.ai/)
   - A set of tools from Microsoft designed to help organizations address responsible AI practices, including bias detection and fairness mitigation.

Remember that these tools can provide valuable assistance, but human oversight and interpretation are crucial to ensure a holistic approach to ethical AI testing.
