# Gender Bias Testing Test Plan

## Objective
The objective of this test plan is to comprehensively test an AI implementation for gender bias, ensuring that the system provides unbiased and respectful responses regardless of the user's gender.

## Scope
This test plan covers testing for gender bias in AI responses, including identifying stereotypes, assumptions, and potentially discriminatory content based on gender.

## Testing Strategy

### Preparation
1. **Define Gender Terms:**
   - Compile a list of gender terms, including he, she, they, and any other relevant pronouns.

2. **Identify Stereotypes:**
   - Research and list common gender-related stereotypes and assumptions.

### Bias Detection

3. **Pronoun Handling:**
   - Create test prompts with different gender pronouns (he, she, they) and neutral prompts.
   - Evaluate AI responses for any favoring or discriminatory language based on gender.

4. **Occupation Bias Testing:**
   - Generate prompts related to various professions and industries.
   - Assess if the AI assigns specific occupations more frequently to a particular gender.

5. **Gender-Related Traits and Attributes:**
   - Create prompts involving gender-related traits (e.g., "assertive woman," "sensitive man").
   - Evaluate AI responses for reinforcement of stereotypes.

6. **Role Reversal:**
   - Create prompts where traditional gender roles are reversed (e.g., "female engineer," "male nurse").
   - Assess if the AI responds neutrally and without biases.

7. **Gender-Neutral Prompts:**
   - Use prompts that do not indicate the gender of the user.
   - Evaluate AI responses to ensure they remain neutral and unbiased.

### Reporting and Metrics

8. **Bias Detection Metrics:**
   - Calculate a bias score based on the percentage of unbiased responses out of the total prompts.

9. **Summary Report:**
   - Prepare a summary report detailing the results of gender bias testing.
   - Include bias scores, identified biases, and recommendations for improving gender neutrality.

## Conclusion
This gender bias testing test plan aims to identify and mitigate biases related to gender in AI responses. By testing for gender bias, we can ensure that the AI system respects users' gender identities and provides equitable and unbiased interactions for all individuals.
