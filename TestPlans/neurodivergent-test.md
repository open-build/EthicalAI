# Neurodivergent Bias Testing Test Plan

## Objective
The objective of this test plan is to systematically test an AI implementation for biases related to neurodivergent individuals, ensuring that the system provides unbiased and respectful responses that consider the diverse perspectives of neurodivergent users.

## Scope
This test plan covers testing for biases in AI responses related to neurodivergent individuals, including identifying stereotypes, assumptions, and potentially discriminatory content.

## Testing Strategy

### Preparation
1. **Define Neurodivergent Categories:**
   - Identify neurodivergent categories such as autism spectrum disorder, ADHD, dyslexia, and others relevant to your application.

2. **Research Neurodivergent Stereotypes:**
   - Research and document common stereotypes and biases related to neurodivergent conditions.

### Bias Detection

3. **Communication Styles:**
   - Create prompts that reflect diverse communication styles associated with different neurodivergent conditions.
   - Evaluate AI responses for sensitivity, understanding, and respect of different communication needs.

4. **Accomplishments and Strengths:**
   - Generate prompts highlighting achievements and strengths of neurodivergent individuals.
   - Assess if the AI recognizes contributions and avoids biases.

5. **Sensory and Social Preferences:**
   - Create prompts about sensory preferences and social interactions of neurodivergent individuals.
   - Evaluate AI responses for understanding and respect of varying preferences.

6. **Educational and Learning Approaches:**
   - Use prompts related to education and learning approaches for neurodivergent individuals.
   - Assess if the AI provides helpful and unbiased information.

7. **Accurate Representation of Conditions:**
   - Generate prompts about specific neurodivergent conditions to assess the AI's knowledge and responses.
   - Evaluate AI responses for accuracy and avoidance of perpetuating myths or stereotypes.

### Reporting and Metrics

8. **Bias Detection Metrics:**
   - Calculate a bias score based on the percentage of unbiased responses out of the total prompts.

9. **Summary Report:**
   - Prepare a summary report detailing the results of neurodivergent bias testing.
   - Include bias scores, identified biases, and recommendations for improving neurodivergent inclusivity.

## Conclusion
This neurodivergent bias testing test plan aims to address biases related to neurodivergent individuals in AI responses. By testing for neurodivergent bias, we can ensure that the AI system respects and accommodates the diverse needs and perspectives of neurodivergent users.
