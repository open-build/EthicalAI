# Age Bias Testing Test Plan

## Objective
The objective of this test plan is to thoroughly test an AI implementation for age bias, ensuring that the system provides unbiased and respectful responses regardless of the user's age.

## Scope
This test plan covers testing for age bias in AI responses, including identifying stereotypes, assumptions, and potentially discriminatory content based on age.

## Testing Strategy

### Preparation
1. **Define Age Ranges:**
   - Define age ranges, such as children, teenagers, adults, and senior citizens.

2. **Identify Age-Related Stereotypes:**
   - Research and list common age-related stereotypes and assumptions.

### Bias Detection

3. **Age-Related Interests:**
   - Generate prompts related to interests and activities associated with different age groups.
   - Evaluate AI responses for biased content or assumptions about interests.

4. **Occupation and Achievements:**
   - Create prompts involving professions and accomplishments associated with various age ranges.
   - Assess if the AI assigns specific occupations or achievements based on age.

5. **Family Roles and Responsibilities:**
   - Generate prompts about family roles and responsibilities across different age groups.
   - Evaluate AI responses for reinforcement of stereotypes.

6. **Technology and Trends:**
   - Create prompts about technology preferences and trends for different age ranges.
   - Assess if the AI assumes or stereotypes technology usage.

7. **Historical and Cultural Context:**
   - Use prompts that touch on historical events and cultural contexts relevant to different age groups.
   - Evaluate AI responses for accurate representation and avoidance of biases.

### Reporting and Metrics

8. **Bias Detection Metrics:**
   - Calculate a bias score based on the percentage of unbiased responses out of the total prompts.

9. **Summary Report:**
   - Prepare a summary report detailing the results of age bias testing.
   - Include bias scores, identified biases, and recommendations for improving age neutrality.

## Conclusion
This age bias testing test plan aims to uncover and address biases related to age in AI responses. By testing for age bias, we can ensure that the AI system treats users of all age groups fairly and provides respectful interactions that are not influenced by age-related stereotypes.
